We use the DartVM for running the persistent dartino process and the testing
scripts. The DartVM binaries we use are declared in sha1 files which
`gclient runhooks` updates.

In order to have a single binary per OS-Arch combination, we use the
same Dart VM executable for driving the testing scripts and for driving
the persistent process.

Please note that this changes our normally used 32-bit binary for driving the
testing scripts in tools/testing/bin/... to be a 64-bit binary.

We don't build these locally, but rely on 4 builders from the client.dart
buildbot for building them in a controlled environment.

  * cross-arm-vm-linux-release-be
  * dart-sdk-linux-be
  * dart-sdk-mac-be
  * dart-sdk-windows-be

The cross-arm-vm-linux-release-be is archiving seperately a full
bundle, but you can easily extract the binary from there.

Please note down the gsutil paths where you got the binaries from so that people
can get the corresponding unstripped versions.

The binaries then need to be uploaded to GoogleCloudStorage and
their sha1 file needs to be checked into the repository.

Before uploading one needs to ensure one has setup the correct
`BOTO_CONFIG` environment variable pointing to a valid boto file which
has permission to write to the GCS bucket.  To ensure that you have
the right permissions you should run '`gsutil.py config` (with the
`gsutil.py` from `depot_tools`) and neither
`gcloud auth login` nor `gsutil config` to make authentication work with
`upload_to_google_storage.py`. If you don't have access to upload ask ricow@
to change the acl.

Then one needs to mark the binaries as executable (this executable bit will be
preserved when downloading the binaries again -- it is stored via metadata on
the GCS objects). 'chmod +x' on the files before uploading.

Afterwards the binaries can be uploaded.

```
cd  third_party/bin/linux
upload_to_google_storage.py -b dartino-dependencies dart
cp dart.sha1 ../../../tools/testing/bin/linux/dart.sha1
upload_to_google_storage.py -b dartino-dependencies dart-arm
cp dart-arm.sha1 ../../../tools/testing/bin/linux/dart-arm.sha1
cd ../mac
upload_to_google_storage.py -b dartino-dependencies dart
cp dart.sha1 ../../../tools/testing/bin/mac/dart.sha1
cd ../win
upload_to_google_storage.py -b dartino-dependencies dart.exe
cp dart.sha1 ../../../tools/testing/bin/win/dart.exe.sha1
```

The sha1 files need to be checked into the repository at
  * `third_party/bin/linux/dart.sha1`
  * `third_party/bin/linux/dart-arm.sha1`
  * `third_party/bin/mac/dart.sha1`
  * `third_party/bin/win/dart.exe.sha1`
  * `tools/testing/bin/linux/dart.sha1`
  * `tools/testing/bin/linux/dart-arm.sha1`
  * `tools/testing/bin/mac/dart.sha1`
  * `tools/testing/bin/win/dart.exe.sha1`

It is highly recommended to test that everything worked, by
  * ensuring only sha1 files have been changed
  * deleting the binaries
  * re-running `gclient runhooks` to download new binaries
  * building & running ./tools/test.py
